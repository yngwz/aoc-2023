# ⭐ Advent of Code 2023 ⭐

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles for 2023.

Puzzle solutions are written in TypeScript and are executed with Bun.

## Structure
Each day's puzzle solution, input, and other supplementary files are stored in a separate directory named after the day.

## Running the Solutions
To run a solution, navigate to the directory of the day and run the `solution.ts` TypeScript file with Bun:

```bash
    cd 1
    bun run solution.ts
```
